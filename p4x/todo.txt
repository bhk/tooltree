 * Mysterious missing file: sync won't work when file opened for edit, so
   'p4x scrub' doesn't work.

     p4x status       -->   ! foo
     p4 sync -f foo   -->   foo - file(s) up-to-date.
     ls foo           -->   no such file
     p4 opened foo    -->   foo#14 - edit default change (text)
     p4 fstat foo
        ... headAction edit
        ... action edit
        ... actionOwner bhk

 * Output error messages to stderr
 * "p4x scrub" when current dir contains new file & edited file: no changes?
      media/imagedecoders/main/latest : edit Makefile
 * "p4x unedit" = remove from changelist, but do not overwrite
 * "p4x diff" ... because "p4 diff" does not work when the local file has
   not been edited.
