This project builds two code coverage tools:

 * `ccov` reads code coverage files in one of several different formats,
   merges them, and writes it out into a common format.

 * `cmet` reads ccov output files and displays tables of statistics.

Each tool contains its own documentation (pass `-h` to see it).
