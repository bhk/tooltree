Overview
--------

    The `event` module returns an object that constructs Event objects.

    . local Event = require "event"

    Event objects perform "edge-triggered" notifications. Any number of
    threads may wait on an event object. When the event object is signaled,
    all waiting threads will be awakened.


Functions
---------

`Event:new()`
.............

     Create and return a new event object.

     . local event = Event:new()

`event:wait()`
..............

    Suspend execution of the current thread. The thread will remain
    suspended until the next time `event:signal()` is called.


`event:signal()`
...............

    Resume execution of all threads that are currently waiting on the event
    object.
