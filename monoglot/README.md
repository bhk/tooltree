# Monoglot

Monoglot is a Lua-based environment that supports an event-driven
cooperative multitasking model.  It supports both threaded and asynchronous
coding styles, allowing multiple connections to be handled simultaneously
within one Lua VM instance.

Lua serves as the extension language for configuration, routing, handlers,
and templating

Monoglot's port to Tooltree (a Git repository with minimal external
dependencies) is ongoing.
