The `httpd` module provides a class that implements an HTTP server.

     . local HTTPD = require "httpd"


Functions
----


`HTTPD.new(addr)`
....

    Create a new instance of an HTTP server.

      * `addr` : the IP address and port to which the listening socket
        should be bound. This is provided in the format specified in
        [`xpio`] (xpio.html#Address Format).


`HTTPD.start(handler)`
....

    Begin serving incoming connections. This function creates a thread for
    accepting connections and returns immediately to the caller.

     * `handler` : a [Stack] (stack.html) handler. This is a function that
       will be called once with each HTTP request, and which returns values
       that describe the response to be sent to the client.

    The server will create a thread for each incoming connection. These
    connection threads handle one or more transaction sequentially. Handler
    functions are called on connection threads.


`HTTPD.stop()`
....

    Terminate the accepting thread and all connection threads.
