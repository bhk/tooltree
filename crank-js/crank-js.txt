Generator Classes
====

`JSTest`
----

Each item names a JavaScript test script that should exit without error on
success.  An empty `.ok` file (the `.out` property) is generated when the
test succeeds.

`JSTest` requires Node.js.  It expects to find an executable named `node` in
the path at build time, and will warn otherwise.

Files that end in `_q.js` are considered "qualifying" tests for the
corresponding `.js` file.  This convention is used to ensure optimal
ordering of the test runs.  Qualifying tests are run before other tests that
use the tested JavaScript file.

Example:

.  JSTest += $(wildcard *_q.js)


`JSBundle`
----

Each item names a JavaScript script that is to be bundled with its
dependencies.

The output file name ends in `.bundle.js`.

Example:

.  JSBundle += ui.js


`JSToHTML`
----

This is the same as JSBundle except an HTML file is generated, containing
the bundled JavaScript in a `script` element.

. JSToHTML += ui.js
