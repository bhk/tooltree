Splitter
####

Overview
------

A splitter is a view whose content area is divided either horizontally
or vertically amongst two child views.  Splitters imbue their child
views with absolute positioning by adding the Fill class to them.

Example:

.   var s = Splitter.create({
.      $topSize: '32',
.      $top: ToolbarView.create(),
.      $bottom: CodeView.creeat()
.   });
.   document.body.appendChild(s.e);


`Splitter.create(props)`
....

     Create and return a new [View] (view.html) instance.

     `props` is a [property description] (view.html#Property Description)
     that contains properties that describe the splitter.

     For a vertical divider, supply `$left` and `$right` abd *either*
     `$leftSize` *or* `$rightSize`.

     For a horizontal divider, supply `$top` and `$bottom` abd *either*
     `$topSize` *or* `$bottomSize`.

     Values for left/right/top/bottom sizes are either numbers (treated as
     CSS pixels) or CSS precentage sizes (e.g. `"50%"`).  These may be
     supplied as observables.  If an observable is supplied and it has a
     `setValue` member, the splitter will be resizsable by dragging an
     invisible divider element.  When dragging computes a new size, it is
     expressed in the same units as the pre-drag size value (a number
     indicating pizels, or a string describing a CSS percentage size).

     `$thickness` is the width/height of the divider. It defaults to 4.
