ASCII Mode
----

`stdin`, `stdout` and `stderr` are in ASCII mode and there is no way to
"fix" that.

When opening files, `"b"` must be included in the mode string, or else they
will be opened in ASCII mode.

We could modify the Lua sources...

  * That would make it easier to write platform-independent code.

  * ... but it would diverge from the "standard" Lua interpreter,
    introducing incompatibility.  We would lose one nice aspect of tooltree:
    the ability to work with existing Lua distros.

Build Issues
----

`*** multiple target patterns` error message when `c:` appears in a
prerequisite.

*Some* builds of GNU Make (those included in newer Cygwin distros) have this
issue. Crank removes all file paths containing `:` from the prerequisite
section of rules.
